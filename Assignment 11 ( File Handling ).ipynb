    "# Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans. \n",
    "# The function used to open a file in Python is the open() function. It is used to create a file object that allows for reading \n",
    "# from or writing to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntx:\n",
    "#       file_object = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. 'r' (Read mode)\n",
    "# - Opens the file for reading only.\n",
    "# - The file must already exist. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "# - The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "# - This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "f = open(\"example.txt\", 'r')\n",
    "content = f.read()\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. 'w' (Write mode)\n",
    "# - Opens the file for writing only.\n",
    "# - If the file already exists, it overwrites the file (truncates it to zero length).\n",
    "# - If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "f = open(\"example.txt\", 'w')\n",
    "f.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. 'a' (Append mode)\n",
    "# - Opens the file for writing but doesn't erase the existing data.\n",
    "# - The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. New data will be written at the end.\n",
    "# - If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "f = open(\"example.txt\", 'a')\n",
    "f.write(\"\\nAppending this line!\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. 'x' (Exclusive creation mode)\n",
    "# - Opens the file for exclusive creation.\n",
    "# - If the file already exists, it raises a FileExistsError.\n",
    "# - If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file and opens it for writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "f = open(\"example.txt\", 'x')  # Will raise an error if file exists\n",
    "f.write(\"This is a new file.\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary and Text Modes\n",
    "# By default, files are opened in text mode, but you can also open them in binary mode by appending a 'b' to the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. 'b' (Binary mode)\n",
    "# - Used for binary files (e.g., images, audio, video).\n",
    "# - When reading or writing in binary mode, data is handled as bytes, not strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - 'rb': Read in binary mode.\n",
    "# - 'wb': Write in binary mode (erases existing content).\n",
    "# - 'ab': Append in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "f = open(\"image.jpg\", 'rb')  # Reading an image in binary mode\n",
    "data = f.read()\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Text Mode (default)\n",
    "# - Text mode is the default if no 'b' is specified. It is used for handling text files.\n",
    "# - You can specify an encoding using the encoding parameter (e.g., 'utf-8').\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. 'r+' (Read and write mode)\n",
    "# - Opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "# - The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "# - The file"

    "# Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",

    "# - Closing a file is essential because:\n",
    "#   - It frees up system resources.\n",
    "#   - It ensures all data is written to the disk.\n",
    "#   - It prevents file corruption.\n",
